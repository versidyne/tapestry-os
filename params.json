{"name":"Tapestry OS","tagline":"Universal Operating System","body":"Tapestry OS - Universal Operating System\r\n=====\r\n#####Overview\r\nThis is the complete core of Tapestry OS, a Unix-Like Operating System in C.  This will eventually be utilized to run long range wireless networking and thin clients for the Tapestry network.\r\n\r\n#####Goals\r\n* Maintain a solid system for which networking, radio frequency modulation, and custom-rom thin clients/video games can be developed with ease.\r\n\r\n* Develop a robust, abstract, kernel with several different architectures and internal gateways that will provide different types of functionality for switching roms to various games, applications, methods, etc, running directly from the kernel as a window manager.  This makes reboots for modes more frequent but will boost performance greatly.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=====\r\n#####Overview\r\nThis is a simple process and will remain as such if instructions are followed carefully.\r\n\r\n#####Configuration\r\nThis is currently not an option, though it will be in the future.\r\n\r\n#####Virtualization\r\nSimply run tapestry.iso as a CD Rom.  This can be done with bochs, qemu, or virtualbox-ose easily.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nqemu --cdrom img/tapestry.iso --boot d -soundhw all\r\n```\r\n\r\n#####Finalizing\r\nThere is currently nothing to finalize.\r\n\r\nSystem Roles\r\n=====\r\n#####Overview\r\nThe roles that follow are separated within a directory specific to its name.  Within these directories, each role will have its format and place in the order of the system as it runs.  The role will dictate where a particular feature will need to go and from there we can maintain quite a vast sense of universal ability.\r\n\r\n#####Boot\r\nThis is where various ASM Bootloader sources are held.\r\n\r\n#####Source\r\nInformation regarding the code will be added soon.","google":"UA-37213453-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
